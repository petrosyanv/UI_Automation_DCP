# UI SAMPLE Automation project

Before you will be able to execute tests locally:
1. Download **chromedriver** for your platform and copy it into **web/drivers** folder
2. Install all dependencies with **pip install -r requirements.txt** (dependencies file located in project root)
3. If you are using IDE - set default test runner to **pytest**.

#### Execute sample WEB UI test (will be deleted soon)

(execute from project root) **pytest web/tests/test_sample.py**

OR **python -m pytest web/tests/test_sample.py**
